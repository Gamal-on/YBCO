## YBCO Heat Capacity Analysis

### Objective:

- Visualize and interpret the experimental data from specific heat measurements for the YBCO compound

- Compare several theoretical models and fitting methods

- Study the effect of doping in the heavily overdoped regime

### Files:

- Python scripts : main files to perform the fit

- plot_data.ipynb: Notebook to visualize the experimental data of the three measured samples: optimally doped YBCO synthesized at high temperature and high pressure (YBCO_HPHT), and overdoped YBCO (YBCO_P240917 and YBCO_ISIS)

- results_YBCO_HPHT.ipynb: Notebook containing the linear fits for undoped YBCO (reference)

- results_YBCO_P24.ipynb: Notebook containing the linear fits for overdoped YBCO (x ≈ 0.3)

- results_YBCO_ISIS.ipynb: Notebook containing the linear fits for overdoped YBCO, cold‐pressed (x ≈ 0.3)

- results_values.md : Markdown file containing all the parameters determined by fitting the data
